# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2020
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Create the framework(boilerplate for the index file of my personal website. I also created the CSS file

**Thoughts:** I was really fun going back to HTML and CSS after being in React for so long. I enjoyed the refresher. I want to learn different CSS frameworks and implement CSS grid.  I also want to redesign the website to use React and different CSS in JS frameworks.

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on index.html and updated the css to list site specific selectors. I also worked on my Precourse work for CodePath Mobile Development Code camp.
**Thoughts:** Today was really about just getting the general format on the page together stylistically. The site will continue to emerge as I continue to work with it.
