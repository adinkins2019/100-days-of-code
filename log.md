# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2020
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Create the framework(boilerplate for the index file of my personal website. I also created the CSS file

**Thoughts:** I was really fun going back to HTML and CSS after being in React for so long. I enjoyed the refresher. I want to learn different CSS frameworks and implement CSS grid.  I also want to redesign the website to use React and different CSS in JS frameworks.

### Day 2: January 3, 2020
####

**Today's Progress**: Continued to work on index.html and updated the css to list site specific selectors. I also worked on my Precourse work for CodePath Mobile Development Code camp.
**Thoughts:** Today was really about just getting the general format on the page together stylistically. The site will continue to emerge as I continue to work with it.

### Day 3: January 4, 2020
####

**Today's Progress**: Today I decide to depart from my personal website and focus on working on my Lambda School Project.  The Project is concerned with using useReducer and the reducer pattern to make a to do app.  Have just started on this project, I manage to get the majority of the look and feel of the web app done. Tomorrow I will focus on finishing and completing the application.

### Day 4: January 5, 2020
####

**Today's Progress**: Today I decide to continue working on the material from my training kit at Lambda School.  I completed some more work on the Reducer To Do app. I also completed some practice problems on the state reducer pattern. 
**Thoughts:** The reducer pattern is a succinct way to add immutability to a project. It's not too difficult to implement overall but understanding where the changes need to be made in the application can be a bit daunting.

### Day 5: January 6, 2020
####

**Today's Progress**: Today I decide to work on some tutorials. I decided to work on the React Tic Tac Toe tutorial
**Thoughts:** I just wanted to make sure that my fundamentals on React are sound and that I'm understanding all of the concepts. I also wanted to brush up on some key concepts
